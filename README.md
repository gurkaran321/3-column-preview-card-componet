## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
1. Using Grid to create 3 columns in desktop version and single column in mobile version.
2. Used Flexbox to set content of each column.
3. Used rem for font-sizing which made easy to change font size.


### Continued development

I want to refine my styling of buttons, it is not upto mark which I will try to do better in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Webdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to refine my CSS concepts.
